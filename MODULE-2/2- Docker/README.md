# Node + Mongo using Docker

In this second section we will start with docker.

First, we will run Our MongoDB instance in docker and we will make sure that we can access it.
Once we have Mongo running we will access it from a Node.js app running on our computer and later we will put that app into a docker container and try to connect directly from one container to another.

Please start a folder 1-Mongo

Good luck!
